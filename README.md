# Modding... Modding never changes

## Description

This is a thorough guide about fixing and enhancing _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, that is, _Fallout 3_ and all its DLCs.

Indeed, there are a lot of _Fallout 3_ modding guides out there, but I would like to contribute with a functional standpoint about the way the mods are installed.

## Installation

For now, all you have is a Markdown file (`Modding never changes.md`), which you can "compile" to HTML. There is a certain sense of elation when you go from this.

To this.

![HTML version of the book](Images/HTML%20version%20of%20the%20book.png)

As you can see, I am using the awesome [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor to create the raw version of the book. In order to compile the Markdown source into the HTML version, I am using the following packages, installed using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation):

* [Markdown Preview](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Preview)
* [MarkdownEditing](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing)
