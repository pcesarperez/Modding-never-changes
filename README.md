# README

This is a thorough guide about fixing and enhancing _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, that is, _Fallout 3_ and all its DLCs.

Take a look at the file `Modding never changes.md`. That is the main guide file, and it will be used to generate different final products (HTML, PDF, etc.).

### Changelog

**[26/06/2016] Section about UI finished.**

The section 4.1 is finished, covering from the HUD to the Pip-Boy. The game should look slightly better now, but not in a blowing-off-your-head way.

Two sections finished about improving how your user interface looks (sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2).
