# README

This is a thorough guide about fixing and enhancing _Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition_, that is, _Fallout 3_ and all its DLCs.

Take a look at the file `Modding never changes.md`. That is the main guide file, and it will be used to generate different final products (HTML, PDF, etc.).

### Changelog

**[24/07/2016] Section about audio overhaul finished.**

New section (4.2. Lend me your ears) about audio overhaul of the game. I have added a short chapter (4.1.7. Shed some light here, please) about Pip-Boy's lamplight revamp.

However, the big thing here is that I had to start modding the game from scratch, because I realized I had to use Paradox's The Mergers patches (along with Blackened compatibility patches) to the next main series of mods (FWE, MMM, EVE and WMK).

I didn't feel comfortable rolling back some mods, and my 7 GB backup copy didn't work because I didn't copy metadata from NMM describing the actual installed mods, so, I had no other choice.

**[10/07/2016] Section about new content finished.**

New section (4.2.3. Expanding your world) about new content mods (_Alton, IL_, _Arefu Expanded_ and _Mothership Zeta Crew_).

**[10/07/2016] Section about _Martigen's Mutant Mod_ finished.**

New section (4.2.2. Fraternizing with the neighborhood) about _Martigen's Mutant Mod_, a mod that adds a lot of new creatures and encounter/fight mechanics to the game.

**[04/07/2016] Corrections and additions.**

Corrections and additions in sections 4.1.3 and 4.2.1.

**[29/06/2016] Section about _Fallout 2 Wanderers Edition_ finished.**
The section 4.2.1 is finished, covering the installation of FWE, letting us play a completely different game, harsher and more challenging.

**[26/06/2016] Section about UI finished.**

The section 4.1 is finished, covering from the HUD to the Pip-Boy. The game should look slightly better now, but not in a blowing-off-your-head way.

**[25/06/2016] Rough draft of the section about UI.**

Two sections finished about improving how your user interface looks (sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2).

**[24/06/2016] First chapter finished.**

The first chapter is about fixing the game. At the end of the chapter, you will have a fully patched and (mostly) flawless game to play with. The content, visuals and mechanics of the game are not altered in this stage.
